I am an independent research fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg. My interests are in the field of galaxy evolution, in particular the structural evolution of galaxies across cosmic time and galaxy mass assembly histories. I use large samples of galaxies in my research, from both extragalactic surveys and cosmological simulations.

Large spectroscopic surveys are central to my research, having based my PhD thesis around the LEGA-C Survey. Currently my main focus is on surveys using the JWST NIRSpec instrument. As member of the JWST/NIRSpec GTO team and PI of JWST Cycle 2 Program RUBIES, I am collecting over 10,000 spectra of distant galaxies and black holes together with my collaborators, to shed light on the physics in the early Universe.
